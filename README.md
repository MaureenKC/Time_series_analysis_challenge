## Process:
# First, configure a Google Colab workspace as follows:

# Open Google Colab (Links to an external site.) and upload your starter notebook.

# Run the provided code in the Install and import the required libraries and dependencies section.

# The second cell will import the dependencies for use in the notebook.
# With  workspace configured, you can begin the Challenge. The instructions are divided into four steps and an optional fifth step, as follows:

## Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

Step 5 (optional): Forecast revenue by using time series models
